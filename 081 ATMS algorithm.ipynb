    "    1. What data is stored in each of the classes defined and why does this data need to be stored?\n",
    "    2. What is the purpose of the itertools.product() function inside the while loop?\n",
    "    3. When performing optimizations on the KB, what is the meaning of a > b when a and b are set objects?\n",
    "    4. Why are frozenset objects used extensively throughout the code?\n",
    "    5. We see the asterisk used inside functions calls in a couple of places (e.g. frozenset.union(*C[u])).  What is the purpose of the asterisk?\n",

We have the follwing assumables: {on_t1, on_t2, on_t3, off_t1, off_t2, off_t3, plugged_sink, plugged_bath, unplugged_sink, unplugged_bath, blocked_d1, blocked_d2, blocked_d3, clear_d1, clear_d2, clear_d3, leaky_t1, leaky_t2, leaky_t3}.  Use the code find all of the minimal explanations for a wet bathroom floor in terms of these assumables.  How many of these correspond to a fault somewhere in the plumbing system?"
